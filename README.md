# First project for Intro to Software Engineering class

For this project, I created a MVC app using React on the frontend (View), NodeJS/Express on the backend (controller functions exposed as REST API endpoints), and mongoose/MongoDB to represent the model and persist the data.

Run the web app:

1. Clone the Repository
2. In a terminal window, navigate to the express-backend package and run the command npm start (for developer mode using nodemon, npm run dev)
3. In another terminal window, navigate to react-frontend and run "npm start"
4. Open a browser and input this URL:  http://localhost:3000


(developer)
1. from express-backend, use nodemon with the command "npm run dev"
2. In react-frontend run "npm start"
3. Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   Backend: http://localhost:8000
